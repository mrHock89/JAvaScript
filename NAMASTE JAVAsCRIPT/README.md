# Starting Learning : 

## Notes:
- Everthinf in JS happens inside an Execution Context.
- EC have two components in it. 1. `Memory` (Variavle Enviroment) and 2. `Code` (Thread of Execution).

- # Memory: 
- Objects, variable and Function is stored in this block.

- # Code:
- Here all code is executed line by line at a time.

- JS is a synchronus `single-threaded` language.
