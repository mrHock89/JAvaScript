# JavaScript and Classes


## OOPs
- collections of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why use OOPs?
- Object literal => {}
- Constractor function
- Prototye
- Classes
- Instance (new, this)

### `new` keyword
- after assigning new keyword 1st empty object is created known as `Instance`.
- constructur is called because of `new` keyword.

## 4 Pillars of OOPs
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Constructer in Object
- > `new` keyword is a constructer functin. 

- > By using `new` we can create multiple instancees from one object.

### What happened after using `new` keyword.
- 1. after using `new` keyword an empty object is created.
- 2. constructer function is called beacuse of `new` keyword and all argument is being packed in this.
- 3. All argument is injected in this object.
- 4. We got our function.
